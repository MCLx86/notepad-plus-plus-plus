Notepad+++ is a fork of Notepad++ 7.9.2, a free (free as in both "free speech" and "free beer") source code
editor and Notepad replacement that supports several programming languages and natural languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by the [GPL 2.0 License](LICENSE).


How is this fork different from Notepad++ ?
-------------------------------------------
The reason I forked Notepad++ is that I'm frustrated with the bloat, unneccessary features, Windows XP support being dropped, constant virtue signaling, and, political statements

Build Notepad+++
